BlinkName
Code to blink my name in morse code.
Using a asynchronous timer to check whether the button is being presses to reset the cycle, this allows the program to check to button constantly opposed to using a delay which delays the whole program and will not be able to check the button until it has come out of the loop.
An alternative way would be to use an interupt which in this case was not as efficient as you would need to put an interupt between every letter and pause to check whether the button is being pressed.
